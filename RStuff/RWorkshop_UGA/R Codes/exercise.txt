[1] Find the built-in dataset named 'cars' and load it on your workspace.

[2] Print the dataset on your console.

[3] Excute some exploratory data analyses on the dataset...

[4] Define a new binary variable for speed in the following way. 
    speed < 25  --->  speed.b = low
    speed >= 25 --->  speed.b = high

[5] Define a new variable (factor) for speed in the following way. 
          speed < 15  --->  speed.l = low
    15 <= speed < 20  --->  speed.l = mid
    20 <= speed       --->  speed.l = high

[6] Define a new variable (factor) for dist in the following way. 
          dist < 20  --->  dist.l = low
    20 <= dist < 40  --->  dist.l = mid
    40 <= dist < 60  --->  dist.l = high
    60 <= dist       --->  dist.l = xhigh

[7] t-test: speed.b vs. dist


[8] One-way ANOVA: speed.l vs. dist 


[9] Contingency table: speed.1 vs dist.l


[10] Regression analysis: speed vs. dist
